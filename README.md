Documenting my journey as a graduate student working with SQL & trying to publish a paper on its error messages


## Fall 2025

      <summary>August/September</summary>


  <h3>Week 1 (August 25th - 31st)</h3>

  <ul>
        <li>Class orientations (CS489: Deep Learning, CS682: Artifical Intelligence, CS784: Scheduling)</li>
        <li>Caught up with professors that I haven't spoken to since the Spring 2025 semester</li>
        <li>Attended Dr.Stefik's kickoff meeting with his research team</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Week 2 (September 1st - 7th)</h3>

  <ul>
        <li>Met with Dr.Stefik to address the steps necessary for the SQL research paper to be formally conducted under IRB approval and the reality of the paper's potential for publishing</li>
        <li>Met with Dr.Cisneros to seek advice regarding the progression of my Masters degree. Learned that average students do not know what their research topic is until their second year of Masters and that first year is heavily class loaded.</li>
        <li>Scheduled to meet with Dr.Stefik's research team next week to discuss the methodology of the experiment and how it can be modified before filing for IRB exemption</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Week 3 (September 8th - 14th)</h3>

  <ul>
        <li>I began a literature review to see if there were any papers published on the topic of SQL in the past three months. (As it has been three months since my last literature view). While searching, I discovered that Toni Taipalus had recently published the paper "Enhanced SQL error messages facilitate faster error fixing". After skimming the paper, it was apparent his experiment was designed in an eeriely similar way to that of my prototype study had previously conducted 3+ months ago. After discussing this with Stefik, in his own words, I was "scooped". On one hand, its unfortunate that my approach has been taken so my paper wouldn't add something totally new to the literature, however, this does mean that my approach and thought process is aligned with that of a well decorated PhD, not bad. To continue this journey without making it a replication study, as the aim is to one day publish this work, my goal has now shifted towards targeting the errors of aggregate functions in SQL, rather than general errors of SQL.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Week 4 (September 15th - 21st)</h3>

  <ul>
        <li>Met with Dr.Nasoz to catch up and gather their opinion on the direction of my study. They emphasized that I should focus on demographics and changing the queries entirely from what I had previously used in my prototype. Additionally, they warned of making the study too complex as that would narrow the number of viable participants.</li>
        <li>Learned that I need to go through Collaborative Institutional Training Initative (CITI) before submitting to IRB as it is required before approval is granted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Week 5 (September 22nd - 28th)</h3>

  <ul>
        <li>Contacted Toni Taipalus via e-mail to establish a line of communication, express my appreciation and admiration for his work, and ask for suggestions regarding my own desire to research SQL in education. Toni is a Finnish researcher who has published numerous papers regarding SQL and how novices interact with it. After discussion, Toni was very pleased with my proposed study idea and willing to help however possible.</li>
      <li>Demographics and aggregate functions were not considered in any of Toni's work and may serve as my opportunity to bring something new to the publishing space</li>
      <li>Dr.Stefik suggested working with a friend of his from Germany who has previously published a paper on SQL, "An Empirical Study on the Possible Positive Effect of Imperative Constructs in Declarative Languages: The Case with SQL"</li>
      <li>My todo list consists of addressing what my target audience for demographics will be (heavily consider who is and isn't a viable candidate), determing what aggregate functions I want to use, determining what functions were used by Toni in his paper, and read the suggested paper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Week 6 (September 29th - October 5th)</h3>

  <ul>
        <li>No work was done in regards to research as this week has been busy with class work deadlines. The todo list of last week still needs to be addressed.</li>
  </ul>
