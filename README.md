# SQLGOD
Documenting my journey as a graduate student working with SQL & trying to publish a paper on its error messages


## Fall 2025

### Week 1 (August 25th - August 31st)
- Class orientations (CS489: Deep Learning, CS682: Artifical Intelligence, CS784: Scheduling)
- Caught up with professors that I haven't spoken to since the Spring 2025 semester
- Attended Dr.Stefik's kickoff meeting with his research team

### Week 2 (September 1st - September 7th)
- Met with Dr.Stefik to address the steps necessary for the SQL research paper to be formally conducted under IRB approval and the reality of the paper's potential for publishing
- Met with Dr.Cisneros to seek advice regarding the progression of my Masters degree. Learned that average students do not know what their research topic is until their second year of Masters and that first year is heavily class loaded. 
- Scheduled to meet with Dr.Stefik's research team next week to discuss the methodology of the experiment and how it can be modified before filing for IRB exemption
